* 2018-10-15: `Zui.floatInput()` is now `Ext.floatInput()`
* 2019-09-27: `Zui.isKeyDown` is now `Zui.isKeyPressed` and another variable also called `Zui.isKeyDown` was added:
  * `Zui.isKeyPressed` is `true` if a key was pressed down on the last frame (only `true` for one frame!)
  * `Zui.isKeyDown` is `true` if at least one key is held down (for an arbitrary amount of time until it is released)
