-Split Scene Region for Rendering
	For kicks, make it so that multiple "cameras" can be rendered onto the same window easily. Be able to slice the window into sections.
	This kind of just sounds fun to do.

-HardClamp Shader for Atlas Sprites
	A shader element that records the original pixel color before a distortion effect. Stores a beforeDistort and afterDistort position for a bounding box.
	If the distorted bounding box doesn't encapsulate the pixel, then restore it to its original color (? maybe)

-Do we have to sort on Shader uniforms as well?
